# "Definition: git status" 
Specifically, explain what the `git status` command is useful for: useful to show what changes are made by me.
How can you access the same information provided by this command if you were using the JupyterLab IDE instead of the terminal? In JupyterLab, you should see a Git tab in the left sidebar. Click on this tab to open the Git extension.
Inside the Git tab, you can navigate to the repository you want to inspect (if multiple repositories are accessible).
